 the process of making data reduction and simulation scripts, using MeqTrees
 and other diverse bits of software.

 Pyxis scripts are essentially Python scripts, with extra convenience features
 provided by the Pyxis framework. Pyxis borrows interface ideas from, among
 others, the Perl language, casapy, pybdsm, etc. Pyxis scripts can be run from
